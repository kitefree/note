| Initial Release                 | 1985                                                         | 1999                                                         |
| De Facto Standard for           | publishing in print                                          | publishing on the web and applications                       |
| Type of Language                | Document preparation system; typesetting language            | Computer markup language                                     |
| Designed to Be                  | written by humans                                            | generated automatically using an equation editor that has a graphical interface |
| Length                          | shorter code                                                 | longer code                                                  |
| Popularity                      | Many STEM instructors will know about and even use           | Many STEM instructors may not know of MathML                 |
| Works With Adaptive Technology? | Not really. For example, a screen reader will read the LaTeX symbols and characters aloud but it will not read the completed equation as one would speak it. | Yes. As long as it is in a file format that supports MathML, using a version of an adaptive technology that understands MathML. If the file format is HTML, the browser and browser version is also important. |
